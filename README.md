## My process

### What I learned
I've learned many thing. I'm totally beginner in the coding world, so i've trapped in tutorial hell for a long time. Luckily I've found this website. In this project, I learned how to use git and github, how the HTML and CSS works and how to make a design using HTML and CSS

By working on this project, I found some difficulties and I'm proud i've solved some of them. And I'm proud of these codes


```css
@font-face {
            font-family: Outfit ;
            src: url(Font/Outfit-Regular.ttf);
        }

        body {
            height: 100vh;
            width: 100vw;
            font-family: outfit;
            display: grid;
            place-items: center;
        }
```

This is the codes that i used for setting the font and placing the card in the center

### Continued development

I've succcessfully placed the card in the middle, but I'm ashamed that I don't really understand the layout. Eventhough frontend mentor give the Desktop and mobile pixel in the style guide, but I don't really understand. So I want to learn the layouting for a responsive website, CSS units like px, %, vh, vw, rem etc, I'd love to learn some javascript for the next project.
